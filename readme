My project show cases inheritence, encapsulation, understanding of logic, interfaces,
abstract classes, adding data, searching for data and file processing. I created 2 file processing classes to display inheritence.
One is an interface which initalises the methods such as search, read and print, display statistics
and add new data. The second file processing class implements these methods and over rides them to
add functionality. When you run the program the terminal show a menu display message with options
the user can do to display different thing. I used a switxh case in the main method for extra
functionality as i could create an infinite loop where the user can keep selecting options instead
of re running the program until 0 is selected which purposfully ends the program.
